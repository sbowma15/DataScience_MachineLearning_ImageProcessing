Overview

This Python program is designed to demonstrate image processing and manipulation using the OpenCV library within a Google Colab environment. It showcases various image operations, including edge detection, noise reduction, and contour extraction.

Getting Started
To run the program in the provided Colab notebook, follow these steps:

Open the notebook in Google Colab.
Execute the code cells by clicking the play button or using the keyboard shortcut "Command/Ctrl+Enter."
The notebook allows you to interactively execute and modify the code cells, combining executable code with rich text.

Features
Image Processing
The program includes examples of image processing techniques:

Grayscale conversion
Edge detection
Noise reduction using median blur
GrabCut algorithm for image segmentation
Contour Extraction
The code demonstrates how to find significant contours in an image, filter out salt-and-pepper noise, and draw contours on the original image.

Interactive Elements
The program includes interactive elements, such as drawing circles on an image using mouse events.

Dependencies
The program relies on the following Python libraries:

NumPy
OpenCV
Matplotlib
Argparse (for command-line arguments)
Usage
